will be credited by the corresponding asset.

Unfilled orders can be canceled at any time.

##### How do I log in?

##### Do you have offline/cold wallet for OBITS?

OBITS are located in a browserbased webwallet only accessible via privated keys located in the cookies of each pc. Nobody is able to access your account, because it is located on the blockchain and only accessible via your own personal pc and password. It is vital that you save the backup key and the password, but if you have both, you will be able to access your account anywhere in the world, from any pc. You do not need a paper wallet to feel safe. All you need is the ability to access with your backup key and password. If one of these are missing you, have lost access to your accout –forever. Please remember to take the first step is to ensure both backup and password are saved in an external hard disc or usb and placed somewhere safe.

##### I made a mistake sending funds to account. I typed wrong address. What do I do? Can you return my funds?

We are not able to access users funds. The only way you can theoretically have your funds returned to you is to send a request to return funds sent by mistake. ALWAYS CHECK THE ADDRESS TWICE.

##### I purchased some tokens/cryptocurrency and now I've lost access to my account. Can you please return my funds?

We are sorry but there is no such possibility. 

##### How do I make FIAT Deposits and Withdrawals?

When you deposit FIAT to your OpenLedger account name, you are sending the amount in question to an OPENLEDGER bank account, and this same amount will then appear as OPEN.USD or OPEN.EUR in your account. This amount will appear the same, provided no costs have been deducted from your side or via any correspondent bank. 
It is FREE to deposit FIAT directly to OpenLedger with a minimum of $50 USD or 50 EUR. Amounts less than this are possible, but charged with a 2% deposit fee with a minimum deposit of $2 USD/2EUR/15 CNY.
When you withdraw any one of the two FIAT pegged assets  - OPEN.USD and OPEN.EUR - directly to FIAT USD or EUR in your own bank account, it will appear with a deducted commission of 3% of the amount, based on minimum withdrawals of $100 USD.

##### Which wallet stores OBITS? Can I create a wallet on OpenLedger?  How can I store OBITS offline like Bitcoin cold wallet?

Your OpenLedger account is your cold wallet, and you are in control of this account on the basis of your of private keys which are stored in your cookies within your browser. OpenLedger is a browserbased webwallet and nobody but you has access to your account. PLEASE REMEMBER to save your password and backup file (.bin file) as this is only way to access your account later on, but with this you can access from anywhere in the world on any computer. You are also able to go to bitshares.org and download the wallet.
