# Deposit Withdraw USD EUR

When you deposit Fiat to your OpenLedger account name, you are sending the amount in question to an OPENLEDGER bank account, and this same amount will then appear as OPEN.USD or OPEN.EUR in your account. Amount will appear the same, provided no costs have been deducted from your side or via any correspondent bank. 

## Deposit and withdrawals fees for Crypto

We have no fees on deposit (that's the coins you see with "OpenLedger" in front in the table below: it means for a deposit of the coin and the fee is always 0). The one exception to this is Maker which has a 1% fee for deposit.

It is otherwise FREE to deposit fiat directly to asset on OpenLedger with a minimum of 50 USD or 50 EUR. Amounts less than this are possible, but charged with a 2% deposit fee and minimum 2 USD/2EUR/15 CNY.EUR When you withdraw any one of the two fiat pegged assets OPEN.USD and OPEN.EUR directly to fiat USD or EUR in your own bank account, it will appear with a deducted commission of 3% of amount and based on minimum withdrawals of 100 USD.
